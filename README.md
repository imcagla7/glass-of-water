## 🎨 Design

This project marks my first experience with **pixel art** and **Figma**! I created all the artwork myself and took inspiration from [Figma's Pixel Art Tutorial](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/14794362149015-Create-pixel-art-in-Figma-Design) page.

I aimed for a **calming and cute design**. By incorporating sounds and animations, I wanted to gamify the experience and create a UI that encourages users to drink more water.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Electron.js** – To develop it as a desktop application
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** – Used for pure development
- **LocalStorage** – To store user data

## 🔊 Sounds

The sound effects in the app were sourced from **Pixabay**, a website offering free sounds.

## 🖋️ Font

I researched and included a **free pixel font** that fits the pixel art style of the project.
